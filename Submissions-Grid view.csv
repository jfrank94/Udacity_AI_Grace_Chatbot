@Gianfrancesco Angelini,Thanks Grace for watching our backs :),
@Julia,"Thanks so much for creating such a beautiful community that meaningful impacted my life. I made friends here that I will continue to stay in touch with after the program, who really changed my experience. The community became such a part of my day to day that I'll truly miss it, which is testament to what a great job you've done here.

Don't know if you know this, but right before signing onto this scholarship, I had done some self-work to get over a mental block where I considered others ""real, legit singer"" but not myself. I've never been willing to give myself that label thinking I didn't deserve it or was too amateur because I don't have repertoire out in the world yet. This community is the first place where I actually used that label to describe myself and included in intros ""I'm a singer."" Was hoping to complete working on my first recorded cover before the course ended so I could share in this beautiful community, but timing and making sure it's up to my standards didn't work out that way.

Stepping up as a student leader and just interacting in this community has backed up and reinforced a lot of self-work I've done and has given me confidence in recent transformations I've made for myself, with solid evidence.

Thank you from the bottom of my heart for the chance to be part of this community and benefit from it.

I hope you keep on pursuing your goals with music production too and hope to hear some of your stuff (or maybe collaborate!) in the near future!",
Oscar Kwok,Thank you for all that you do! The job of a community manager is very hard work but is one of the most important and rewarding roles out there. You were the one who brought us all together!,
LuchoTurtle,"It's actually funny that throughout the course, I didn't actively participate in the AMA sessions when they indeed happened, I could only check to see the aftermath (darn time zones!). But regardless, seeing how Grace tirelessly answers almost all questions is absolutely commendable.

The Slack channel has a staggering amount of students and it is no easy feat to stay in touch and up to par to what's actually going on. The way Grace went about it is incredible, in my opinion! Always available to clarify any doubts, even these were already answered prior at some point. And doing this with a cheerful attitude is just mesmerizing. Whatever success the students' have with this course can owe greatly to Grace, she's been there from the get-go and her power of will helped many lads push through their courses. 

Nothing but appraisal for her! Cheers for Grace!",
